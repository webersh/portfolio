    <h1> Designing for Healthcare </h1>
    <p> Designing for a healthcare audience, whether it be patients or clinicians, is challenging and fascinating. It requires designers to get down into a very granular level of detail. Does adding this button create too many clicks for a clinician to perform as she documents her patient care? Will a patient with low health literacy be able to navigate a diabetes management application? Having a thorough and robust design process helps me to navigate these challenges and ensure the final product is acceptable. </p>
    <h1> Gather Requirements</h1>
    <p> My process is iterative and requires a high level of stakeholder input at every point. Gathering requirements through interviews, workflow mapping, and basic background research allows me to understand what is being asked, what the need is, or where current breakdowns are occuring. </p>

    <h1>Brainstorm and Design</h1>
    <p> After gathering information and research and validating the findings with the appropriate stakeholders, it's time to start designing. Start with brainstorming ideas and concepts, which leads to sketching, which leads to creating lo-fidelity prototypes. </p>
    <h1> Validate </h1>
    <p> No design process is complete without feedback. At every point and iteration, I bring stakeholders and end users into the process to ask for feedback. Each time, I incorporate this feedback and update and adjust the designs as necessary until there is a viable design that satisfies all requirements and needs.</p>
