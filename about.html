    <h1>I find the healthcare space fascinating due to the great challenges it presents, but more importantly, the opportunities it presents to create lasting change and impact. </h1>
    <p> I have five plus years working on the implementation and support side of healthcare software, specifically for the purposes of quality management and patient safety. In these roles, I saw firsthand how the technologies clinicians rely on can be cumbersome and not tailored to clinical settings. I'm interesting in applying user experience principles to make healthcare technologies blend effortlessly with clinical practice.</p>
    <h2> On a more personal level...</h2>
    <p>I am an East Coaster through and through who is adapting to the Midwestern while attending the University of Michigan for graduate school. I have family roots on Cape Cod and in Switzerland, so I am comfortable on both water and snow.</p>
